# YoutubeWrapped
## An inspired mini version of Spotify wrapped for YouTube:wink:

*Disclaimer: JS is not my area of expertise and this is just a hobby project. There will be UI and performance updates shortly, as this is a very early stage.*

***Usage instructions:***
1. Request your YouTube history data from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21175650/205507733-67227850-ed10-4ef2-9b10-1639399f160c.png)
2. When the takeout file is ready, download and extract it. It contains 'watch-history.html'.
3. To view your YouTube statistics, go to https://kgarun.github.io/YoutubeWrapped/ and input 'watch-history.html'.
4. The file is not uploaded anywhere, it is simply processed in the browser:smiley:.
